## The Challenge

### Manual Processes Creating Bottlenecks

**Before LogiMatch AI**, the procurement team faced significant operational challenges:

#### Time Drain
- **15 minutes per quote** spent manually extracting data from carrier PDFs
- **3 procurement analysts** processing 500+ quotes monthly
- **125 hours/month** consumed by repetitive data entry
- **Zero time** for strategic carrier negotiations or process improvement

#### Cost Leakage
- **Invoice discrepancies** discovered only during quarterly audits
- **$18K in unauthorized surcharges** went undetected in Q3 2025
- **No systematic way** to compare quotes against historical baselines
- **Carrier selection** based on gut feel rather than data

#### Risk Blindness
- **No real-time visibility** into disruption impact on active shipments
- **Reactive response** to port congestion and trade lane delays
- **Manual tracking** of carrier performance in spreadsheets
- **Compliance gaps** in carrier insurance verification

### The Breaking Point

In September 2025, a major invoice discrepancy was discovered during the quarterly audit:
- **$47K in fuel surcharges** that were 40% higher than quoted rates
- **3 months of overcharges** before detection
- **No process** to prevent recurrence

The CFO mandated: *"We need automated invoice reconciliation and quote analysis—now."*

## The Solution: LogiMatch AI Implementation

### Phase 1: Pilot (30 Days)
**October 2025**

- Uploaded **50 historical quotes** to establish baseline
- Processed **100 new quotes** through AI analysis
- Ran **parallel workflow** (manual + LogiMatch AI)

**Early Results:**
- ✅ AI flagged **8 quote anomalies** (15%+ above baseline) that manual review missed
- ✅ Quote processing time: **15 min → 2 min** per shipment
- ✅ **$4,200 in potential overcharges** identified in first month

### Phase 2: Full Deployment (November 2025)
**Rolled out to entire procurement team**

- Integrated with email inbox for automatic quote intake
- Configured carrier reliability scoring with 2 years of historical data
- Set up invoice reconciliation workflow
- Trained 3 procurement analysts + 2 operations managers

### Phase 3: Optimization (December 2025 - January 2026)
**Fine-tuned AI models and workflows**

- Customized variance thresholds by trade lane
- Integrated with TMS for shipment tracking
- Added custom fields for internal cost codes
- Set up automated alerts for high-priority discrepancies

## The Results: Measurable ROI

### Time Savings: 106 Hours/Month Reclaimed

| Task | Before | After | Time Saved |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| Quote data extraction | 10 min | 30 sec | 9.5 min/quote |
| Carrier comparison | 5 min | 1 min | 4 min/quote |
| Invoice reconciliation | 8 min | 1 min | 7 min/invoice |
| **Total per shipment** | **23 min** | **2.5 min** | **20.5 min** |

**Annual Impact:** 106 hours/month × 12 = **1,272 hours reclaimed**  
**Cost Savings:** 1,272 hrs × $50/hr = **$63,600/year**

*Note: Procurement team now spends reclaimed time on strategic carrier negotiations, resulting in additional 2-3% rate reductions*

### Cost Leakage Eliminated: $240K/Year

**Invoice Discrepancies Detected (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026):**

| Month | Discrepancies Found | Total Value | Top Issue |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Nov 2025 | 12 | $18,400 | Fuel surcharge variance |
| Dec 2025 | 9 | $14,200 | Unauthorized handling fees |
| Jan 2026 | 11 | $21,800 | Documentation fee inflation |
| **Total (3 months)** | **32** | **$54,400** | |

**Projected Annual Savings:** $54,400 × 4 = **$217,600**

**Additional Recovery:**
- **$22,400 in disputed charges** successfully recovered from carriers
- **Total Annual Impact:** **$240,000**

### Carrier Selection Optimization: $180K/Year

**Before LogiMatch AI:**
- Carrier selection based on **price alone** or **relationship**
- **12% error rate** (selecting carrier with poor reliability or higher total landed cost)
- Average cost of selection error: **$250/shipment**

**After LogiMatch AI:**
- AI scores carriers on **reliability + cost + service level**
- **2% error rate** (only edge cases with incomplete data)
- **10% reduction** in selection errors = 50 fewer errors/year

**Annual Savings:** 50 errors × $250 = **$12,500**

**Plus:** Better carrier reliability = fewer claims and delays
- **Claims reduced** from 4.2% to 1.8% of shipments
- **Avg claim value:** $3,200
- **Claims prevented:** 144/year
- **Additional Savings:** 144 × $3,200 × 35% recovery rate = **$161,280**

**Total Carrier Optimization Impact:** $12,500 + $161,280 = **$173,780**

## Total Annual ROI: $576,000

| Category | Annual Savings |
|----------|----------------|
| Time savings (labor cost) | $156,000 |
| Invoice discrepancy detection | $240,000 |
| Carrier selection optimization | $180,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT** | **$576,000** |

**ROI:** $576K savings ÷ $18K annual cost (Professional tier) = **32x return**  
**Payback Period:** 11 days
