## The Problem: Manual Freight Procurement is Bleeding Money

**Mid-size freight forwarders and 3PLs lose $500K+ annually to:**
- ⏱️ **15 minutes per quote** spent on manual data entry and comparison
- 💸 **95% of invoice discrepancies** go undetected until year-end audits
- 🎲 **12% carrier selection errors** from incomplete reliability data
- 📊 **Zero visibility** into real-time disruption impact on active shipments
